BIYBL / TheBible.at 
===================

Welcome to BIYBL (Bible in your best language) the open source project that powers TheBible.at - giving everyone the bible in their own language right when they need it.

A live public access version of this application is available at [theBible.at](http://thebible.at) where you can sign up as an organisation and provide the tool to your members free of charge.  However, as always with open source projects, you can also download the code, install and set up your own application. This README will help you do that.
