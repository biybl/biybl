  	<h1>About BIYBL</h1>

    <p>BIYBL - Bible In Your Best Language - helps speakers of other languages
    engage deeply with God's word during church events.</p>

    <p>Many churches are blessed with foreign visitors who do not speak the
    language the service is conducted in well, if at all. They could be
    students, refugees, immigrants or simply holidaymakers. These people have
    been drawn to Christians and their meetings, but how do we help
    them leave the building with more than just bemusement?</p>

    <h2>For Individuals</h2>

    <p>If you find yourself sitting next to someone who is clearly lost
    Bible due to language issues, bring up the site on your phone,
    enter the passage reference, and then hand it to them. It will hopefully
    be obvious to them what to do - they can choose their language, and then
    read the passage in it. They
    can then refer to this while the Word is being read and preached, to help
    them understand better what is going on.</p>

    <h2>For Churches</h2>

    <p>Churches have the opportunity to have BIYBL remember the passage(s)
    you are studying that week, and get a static and readable URL which will
    Do The Right Thing each time.</p>

    <p>For your church to use BIYBL, sign up on the site. You'll define a
    username and password that you or your church administrator will use to
    log in each week to tell BIYBL the passages you are studying that week.
    You will also be given a URL which does not change. This URL
    can be printed in your church bulletin, turned into a QR code and pasted
    into your pew Bibles, or set as the home page for the cheap tablets your
    church lends to foreign visitors.</p>

    <p>That well-known URL simply provides a list of languages to choose from.
    When the visitor recognises and chooses their language, they are
    immediately presented with the week's passage(s) in that language. They
    can then refer to this while the Word is being read and preached, to help
    them understand better what is going on.</p>

    <br>

    <p>BIYBL is a free service built in October 2015 at the London instance of
    the Code for the Kingdom Global Hackathon, by Ben Drury, Gervase Markham
    and David Fedor.</p>
